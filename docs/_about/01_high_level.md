### Overview

Jito Tip Router NCN is handling operation of distribution of MEV tips generated from the Jito Tip Distribution protocol. The system is made of 3 components: 

- Onchain NCN program
- Node Operator Client
- Permissionless Cranker

#### Onchain NCN Program (Jito Tip Router Program):

Onchain NCN program has several components:

- Pricing
  - NCN Admin or Switchboard determines the relative weight of assets ( jitoSOL, JTO, ... ) deposited in all the Vaults linked to this Jito Tip Router NCN.

- Snapshot
  - Take snapshots of Operator and Vault per epoch.

- Core Logic (Consensus)
  - Prepare Ballot Box, all votes would be collected here. 
  - Each operator calculate the merkle tree to produce merkle root then cast vote with produced merkle root.
  - After consensus reached with more than 2/3, cranker can upload the merkle tree of each validator.

- Reward Payment

#### Node Operator Client

- Node operators will compute a `meta merkle root` â€” a merkle root derived from a new merkle tree containing all validator merkle trees.
- Upload `meta merkle root` on-chain.


#### Permissionless Cranker

- Take snapshots of Operator and Vault per epoch.

When a NCN, operator, and vault have all opted-in to each other and the vault has staked assets to the operator, those
assets are considered staked to the NCN. The operator will then be able to participate in the NCN's consensus protocol.
Assuming the vault has opted-in to the slasher, the staked assets can be slashed.
